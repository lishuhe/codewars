# Write a function that takes in a string of one or more words, and returns the same string, but with all five or more letter words reversed
# (Just like the name of this Kata). Strings passed in will consist of only letters and spaces.
# Spaces will be included only when more than one word is present.

# Examples:
# spinWords( "Hey fellow warriors" ) => returns "Hey wollef sroirraw"
# spinWords( "This is a test") => returns "This is a test"
# spinWords( "This is another test" )=> returns "This is rehtona test"
